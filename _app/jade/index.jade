      .speech-bubble.speech-bubble__left.bg-seethe
        h3 How does the treatment work?
        p.
          The treatments work by effectively eliminating all adult mosquitoes onsite and by leaving a residue on the foliage and and vegetation that we spray.
          In addition we apply a 2nd step, a granular larvacide to eliminate the thousands of eggs just waiting to hatch.
